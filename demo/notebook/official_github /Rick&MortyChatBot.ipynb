This tutorial will cover deploying our new bot to [Chai](https://chai.ml/), a platform for creating and interacting with conversational AI's. It will allow us to chat with our bot through a mobile app, from anywhere, at any time. We will also be able to see performance stats and watch it climb the Chai bot leaderboard.\n",
